# Task Manager Pro

This is a React-based task management application that demonstrates the use of advanced data structures for efficient task handling. It uses a **Binary Heap (Max-Heap)** to quickly access the highest-priority task and an **AVL Tree** for fast, balanced searching and deletion of tasks by ID.

The application features a real-time, animated visualization of the AVL Tree structure, which updates dynamically as you add or complete tasks.

## Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Data Structures**:
  - Custom-built Binary Heap (Max-Heap) for O(1) access to the top task.
  - Custom-built AVL Tree for O(log n) insertion, deletion, and search.
- **Persistence**: Browser `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add tasks with a description, priority, and due date.
- **Priority Queue**: A "Top Task" card always shows the task with the highest priority (and earliest due date as a tie-breaker).
- **Task List**: View all current tasks.
- **Complete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the system.
- **Animated AVL Tree**: Watch the self-balancing binary search tree automatically update with smooth animations for insertions, deletions, and rotations.

## How It Works

The application is coordinated by the `useTaskManager` custom hook, which manages two in-memory data structures:

1.  **BinaryHeap**: When a task is added, it's pushed into the heap. The heap ensures that the task with the highest `priority` value is always at the root, making it trivial to find the most important task.
2.  **AVLTree**: The same task is also inserted into the AVL tree, using its unique ID as the key. The AVL tree automatically balances itself, guaranteeing that operations like finding or deleting a specific task are always fast and efficient.

All tasks are persisted in `localStorage`, and the data structures are rebuilt in memory every time the application loads.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or a compatible package manager

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd task-manager-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Project Structure

- `src/lib`: Contains the core data structure implementations (`heap.js`, `avl.js`) and the persistence logic (`storage.js`).
- `src/hooks`: Houses the main application logic in `useTaskManager.js`.
- `src/components`: Contains all the React components for the UI, including the `AVLVisualizer.jsx`.
- `src/App.jsx`: The main application component that ties everything together.
